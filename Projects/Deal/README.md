# Deal

BadDeal and GoodDeal.

what are the differences.

You can compile and run these sources by

`javac *.java` in a terminal and then `java Deal` to run the compiled class. Make sure you are in the same directory as the source files. (do a `pwd` to check. or doa `ls` to that the java and class files are in the same directory)

## BadDeal

to run, do `java BadDeal`
why does it produce an Error?

run `javac BadDeal.java` and then `java BadDeal` to see the error.

## GoodDeal

to run, do `java GoodDeal`
why does it not produce an Error?

run `javac GoodDeal.java` and then `java GoodDeal` to see the output.

Now, if you run `java BadDeal 5` you will see that it does not produce an error. Why?

And run `java GoodDeal 3` to see the output. See the difference?

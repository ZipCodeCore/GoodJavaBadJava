# ATM

there some things wrong in the code, can you fix it?

`javac *.java`

and then

`java ATM`

How would you add the ability to exit the program gracefully?

Can you imagine a way or three of adding the ability to store and load customer data on every run?

Big Problem: _It's kind of a drag to have a bank program that loses its customer data each time it runs._

What kind of options can you imagine for storing customer data? a file? a database? a cloud service?

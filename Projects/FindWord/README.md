An example of why sometimes it is okay to use static in your classes.

BadFindWord and GoodFindWord.

What are the differences?

You can compile and run these sources by

`javac *.java` in a terminal and then run the compiled class. 
Make sure you are in the same directory as the source files. 
(do a `pwd` to check, or do an `ls` to ensure that the java and class files are in the same directory)

## BadFindWord

Run `javac BadFindWord.java` and then `java BadFindWord` to see the operations.

## GoodFindWord

Run `javac GoodFindWord.java` and then `java GoodFindWord` to see the output.

# TODO List

BadToDoList and GoodToDoList.

What are the differences?

You can compile and run these sources by

`javac *.java` in a terminal and then `java` "soomething" (see below) to run the compiled class. Make sure you are in the same directory as the source files. (do a `pwd` to check, or do an `ls` to ensure that the java and class files are in the same directory)

## BadToDoList

Run `javac BadToDoList.java` and then `java BadToDoList` to see the operations.

## GoodToDoList

Run `javac GoodToDoList.java` and then `java GoodToDoList` to see the output.

## Now add functionality

- a class that takes an arraylist of tasks and saves to file?
- integrate it into the program.
- would it be easier to use JSON somehow?
- what about a database? like sqlite3 or h2?

(If you're not sure what sqlite3 or h2 are, look them up. They are both databases that can be used in Java.)
